                        <h2>Internet History</h2> 
                        <time datetime="2019-01-31"> 1/31/2019</time>
                        <p>It’s true that in the nation currently, we’re in a time where there’s constantly information thrown at us--about ourselves, about the nation, anything really--that it’s almost impossible to determine what is “accurate” and “true”.</p>

                        <p>Following this, we know that the media has so much impact on decisions made in the US, such as presidential elections! So many studies have been done on the credibility of the media and news, and it’s even been shown that Democrats give news platforms higher credibility rates than Republicans (People Press). This fact seems almost obvious, as there’s an obvious current negative opinion of the media in the Republican party. Given this fact, that Democrats view the media so much differently than Republicans, why is this so? Is it that media platforms, by number, are just more liberal and progressive? Is it in the personality traits of the different parties (such that Democrats are more trusting of others? Republicans are more cautious?). It’s also difficult, because as a consumer of information daily, it’s impossible to determine what is true--we’re not experts in the field, and often aren’t given access to seeing potential biases.</p>

                        <p>Even in elementary schools, teachers and students have been affected by the information the media gives. For example, science teachers across the nation have been in an ongoing battle between what is science and fake news. Students, one way, learn what is taught, and in another way, read what may be untrue online. Given this trend, I’m personally afraid for how what I’ve been taught in schools may be so much different from what children in 20 or 30 years learn--and I think it’s a fear that we should have, as the future comes.</p>
