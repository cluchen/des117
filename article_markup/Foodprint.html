                <h2>Sloan Hexagon</h2>
                <p>The Sloan Hexagon is a local strategy (explains cognitive science as local integrations across levels of organization and levels of explanation) response to the integration challenge. Built by leading experts in each field and with the Sloan Foundation, the Sloan Hexagon notes that 6 disciplines make up cognitive science (philosophy, AI / computer science, neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, anthropology), and notes that they each study the mind from different perspectives. The Sloan Hexagon works to build interdisciplinary connections between disciplines, as dotted lines equal weak connections and undotted lines equal strong connections. Overall, the Sloan Hexagon is meant to show that there is more to cognitive science than just an overlap in interest; interdisciplinary connections build cognitive science.</p>

                <h2>Inter-theoretic Reduction</h2>
                <p>This model is a global strategy (a holistic) approach for explaining how cognitive science as a whole fits together. The inter-theoretic reduction model aims to solve the integration challenge by reducing the theories of cognitive science into a fundamental theory. Reduction can be explained as a relation between two theories or more, at which one is the most fundamental; it is an interconnection group of laws through bridge laws. For example, we can look at the philosophy of science. By inter-theoretic reduction, the laws in biology should be reducible to the laws of chemistry, and the laws of chemistry should be reducible to the laws of physics. Thus, all the sciences will ultimately prove to be reducible to the most fundamental form of physics. We can use this model to solve the integration challenge, as all space in higher levels of organization in the space of cognitive science / 3-D model should be able to be reduced into lower levels of organization. All the theories of cognitive science should be able to be reduced into a fundamental theory, which would make up cognitive science.</p>

                <h2>The Space of Cognitive Science</h2>
                <p>The space of cognitive science / 3-D model is a local strategy answer to the integration challenge. The different parts of cognitive science can be distributed across a 3-dimensional space, as shown in the 3-D axis model. This model explains the integration problem - that the ultimate goal for cognitive science is to provide a unified account of cognition that integrates the whole space. The space is built upon the different axes. The x-axis equals different cognitive domains, such as vision, hearing, etc. pertaining to subfields of psychology, for example; y-axis equals investigative techniques, such as fMRI, PET scan, for example; z-axis equals levels of organization, such as the brain, neurons, etc. pertaining to the levels in neuroscience, for example. The model demonstrates the 3 dimensions which can vary in cognitive science, and the theory is that by uniting all things within the space, we can solve the integration problem.</p>

                <h2>The Mary Thought Experiment</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>In the first premise, Mary, while in the black and white room, learns all physical facts. In other words, Mary knows every physical fact there is to know about the environment prior to leaving the room. This is plausible as she has read every book in the room; all the science books are finished and fully developed versions, so she should know everything there is to know about her surroundings and the environment, even without having stepped out of the room. She knows color perception and the mental and visual processes for seeing red without actually having have seen the color red.</p></li>
                    <li><p>In the second premise, Mary, after leaving the room, learns something new. In other words, Mary has learned a new fact, as she has stepped out of the room where she supposedly learned all physical facts. She can learn about all the physical qualities / processes in seeing red, she can imagine red, and she can know everything in the environment that is red, but these are different than actually having the color experience of seeing the color red. <blockquote>An actual experience is different than knowing all there is to know about that experience. Thus, she learns a new fact.</blockquote></p></li>
